# Utilizing Head-Tracking Algorithms to Facilitate Dynamic 3D Projections

## Description
Capstone is an innovative project aiming to create a projection that alters based on the user's head location. This creates a more immersive 3-dimensional image, adjusting the visual experience according to the viewer's position.

## Ultimate Goal
The ultimate aspiration for this project is to provide an interactive experience where the projection seamlessly changes as the user moves their head, effectively creating a dynamic 3D visual experience.

## Repo Structure
This repository contains essential components for the operation and development of the Capstone project:
- `PythonClient.py`: Handles all head tracking processes.
- `MyListener.cs`: Responsible for manipulating all the assets within the UNITY project.

## Project Status
Currently, Capstone can detect a user's face and adjust the projection assets accordingly. However, the reaction time for these adjustments is slower than desired, making it challenging to provide a truly immersive experience. Future improvements aim to enhance this speed and responsiveness.

## Contributions and Feedback
We welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve the project's performance and functionalities. If you'd like to contribute or have any queries, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
